Dictionary in Python:
	dictionaries are unordered mapping for storing objects. previously we saw how lists store objects in an ordered sequence, dictionaries use a key:value pairing instead.
	
	This key:value pair allows users to quickly grab objects without needing to know an index location.
	
Dictionaries use curly braces and colons to signify the keys and their associated values.

	{"key1":"value1","key2":"value"}
	
so when to choose a list and when to choose a dictionary?

    dictionaries: objects retrieved by key name.

unordered and can not be sorted.

all we need key value pair to call the dictionary.
	
we will insert by using key:value pair

# lists: objects retrieved by location.

# ordered sequence can be indexed or sliced.

dictionary:

my_dict = {'key1': 'value1',"key2:value2"}

my_dict

my_dict["key1"]

output: "value1"

prices_lookup = {"apple":150,"orange":200,"strawberry":350}

prices_lookup["strawberry"]

output --> 350

a dictionary can hold a list , another dictionary also

d = {"key1": 123,"key2":[0,1,2],"key3":{"inside_key3":100}}
here key1 hold 123
key2 hold [0,1,2]
key3 hold another dictionary inside_key3:100


if we want to print [0,1,2]

print(d["key2"])

if we want to print -- inside_key3:100

print(d["key3"])

if we want to print 100

print(d["key3"]["inside_key3"])

100

if i want to print 2

print(d["key2"][2])

2

if we want to add new key value pair 

d["key4"] = 300

d["key4"] = 400

new value assigned

print(d.keys())
print(d.values())
print(d.items())
dict_keys(['key1', 'key2', 'key3', 'key4'])
dict_values([123, [0, 1, 2], {'inside_key3': 100}, 300])
dict_items([('key1', 123), ('key2', [0, 1, 2]), ('key3', {'inside_key3': 100}), ('key4', 300)])


d_2 = {"key1":["a","b","c"]}
print(d_2["key1"],[2].upper())

FAQ:

Do dictionaries keep an order? How do I print the values of the dictionary in order?

Dictionaries are mappings and do not retain order! If you do want the capabilities of a dictionary but you would like ordering as well, check out the ordereddict object lecture later on in the course!
