Tuples:
Tuples are very similar to lists.
However they have one key difference - immutability
once an element is inside a tuple, it can not be reassigned.
tuples use paranthesis: (1,2,3)

t = (1,2,3)

mylist = [1,2,3]

type(t)
list

type(mylist)
list

len(t)
3

t = ('one',2)

t[0]
'one'

t[-1]
2

two basic built-in methods:

index method

count method

t = ('a','a','b')

t.count('a')
2

t.index('a')
0

t.index('b')
2

tuple is a tuple we can't change it.

t[0] = "new"

Error:
	Tuple object does not support item assignment.
	
We have flexibility in list, why we need a tuple???

beginning programmer doesn't use tuples often,,
real usage of tuple when become 
while we're passing around objects in your program,
need to make sure that they don't accidentally get changed.(data integrity)

we can't reassignment by accident.
