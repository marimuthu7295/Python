Unique Features of Python

Simple and Easy to Learn

	English-like syntax

	Less code compared to other languages

Interpreted Language

	Code executed line by line

	No need for compilation

Dynamically Typed

	No need to declare data types explicitly

	Type is decided at runtime

High-Level Language

	Handles memory management automatically

	Programmer focuses on logic, not hardware details

Object-Oriented

	Supports classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism

	Also supports procedural and functional programming

Platform Independent

	Same code runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS

Large Standard Library

	Built-in modules for math, file handling, OS, networking

	Reduces dependency on external libraries

Extensible and Embeddable

	Can integrate with C, C++, Java

	Python code can be embedded into other applications

Open Source and Free

	Freely available and community-driven

	Large developer support and documentation

Strong Community Support

	Massive online resources, forums, and tutorials

	Continuous updates and improvements
	
	
Python 2 vs Python 3 

	Python has two major versions: Python 2 and Python 3

	Python 2 was released in 2000

	Python 3 was released in 2008

	Python 2 is no longer supported (stopped in 2020)

	Python 3 is the current and future version

Identifiers:
	Identifiers are names, and they can name variables, functions, classes, and objects.	

# variable identifier
	age = 20

# function identifier
	def show_age():
		print(age)

# class identifier
	class Student:
		pass

# object identifier
	s1 = Student()

# calling function
	show_age()
