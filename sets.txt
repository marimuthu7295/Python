sets in python:

sets are unordered collection of unique elements.
meaning there can be one representative of the same object.
let's see some examples!

myset = set()
print(myset)
set()

myset.add(1)
print(myset)

{1}

add a list inside a set

mylist = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,]

print(set(mylist))
{1,2,3}
