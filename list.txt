Lists:
Lists are ordered sequences that can hold a variety of objects types.

They use [] brackets and commas to seperate objects in the list

[1,2,3,4,5]

Lists suppor indexing and slicing. list can be nested and also have a variety of useful methods that can be called off of them.

my_list = [1,2,3]

my_list = ['string,100,23.2]

len(my_list)
3

mylist = ['one','two','three']

mylist[0]
one

mylist[1:]

two, three

mylist

another_list =  ['four','five']

new_list = mylist + another_list

print(new_list)

['one','two','three','four','five']

new_list.append("six")

print(new_list)

['one','two','three','four','five','six']

new_list.pop()

'six'

the last value deleted - poped

print(new_list)

['one','two','three','four','five']

popped_item = new_list.pop()

print(popped_item)

'six'

new_list.pop(0)

index -> 0 first value deleted --> "one"

new_list = ['a','e','x','b','c']
num_list = [4,1,8,3]

new_list.sort()

['a','b','c','e','x']

my_sorted_list = new_list_sort()

print(my_sorted_list)

No output displayes as well as no error

type(my_sorted_list)

NoneType

Nonetype -- > nonetype is the type for a none object.it's a special object in python called "None". 
that indicate "no value"
a lot of time people hold it as a placeholder
the return value of a function or a method that doesn't actually return anything.
It'a common default return value for a function that maybe search for something and may and may not find it.

new.list.sort()

my_sorted_list = new_list

then

print(my_sorted_list)

num_list

[4,1,8,3]

num_list.sort()

print(num_list)

[1,3,4,8]

num_list.reverse()

num_list

[8,4,3,1]
